## Learning Approach

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Logic First** | Build solutions without over-relying on built-in shortcuts |
| **Clean Code** | Write modular, reusable methods with clear naming |
| **Edge Cases** | Handle invalid input, overflow, and boundary conditions |
| **Real-World Mapping** | Scenario-based problems mirror actual use cases |
| **Incremental Growth** | Start simple, then add validation and optimization |

---

## Current Status

**Completed:** Core Java fundamentals (Week 1) and OOP basics with Classes & Objects (Week 2 - Day 1).

**Next Steps:** Continue with OOP concepts - Encapsulation, Constructors, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
