## Learning Approach

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Logic First** | Build solutions without over-relying on built-in shortcuts |
| **Clean Code** | Write modular, reusable methods with clear naming |
| **Edge Cases** | Handle invalid input, overflow, and boundary conditions |
| **Real-World Mapping** | Scenario-based problems mirror actual use cases |
| **Incremental Growth** | Start simple, then add validation and optimization |

## Current Status

**Completed:** Core Java fundamentals (Week 1) and OOP concepts including Classes & Objects, Constructors, Static/Non-static methods, Access Modifiers, Abstract classes & Interfaces, Relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition), UML diagrams, and Inheritance patterns (Week 2).

**Next Steps:** Continue with advanced OOP topics - Polymorphism, Exception Handling, and Collections Framework.

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

- **30-Dec-2025 (Tuesday):** Started OOP concepts - Classes and Objects. Completed Snake & Ladder game (UC1-UC7) with single and two-player modes. Solved basic OOPs practice programs.
- **31-Dec-2025 (Wednesday):** Developed a clear understanding of safe Git workflows, including proper branch management, committing practices, and repository handling techniques to avoid data loss and merge conflicts, along with gaining conceptual and practical knowledge of constructors in Java for object initialization and class design.
- **01-Jan-2026 (Thursday):** Studied static vs non-static methods and blocks. Learned access modifiers (private, default, protected, public). Implemented abstract classes and interfaces with method overriding and hiding concepts.
- **02-Jan-2026 (Friday):** Implemented association, aggregation, and composition relationships. Created UML diagrams. Built class, object, and sequence diagrams.
- **03-Jan-2026 (Saturday):** Practiced inheritance hierarchies. Implemented single, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance patterns.
- **05-Jan-2026 (Monday):** Built multiple OOP-based mini-systems: E-Commerce Platform, Vehicle Rental System, Banking System, and Library Management System, focusing on abstraction, interfaces, and clean encapsulation for domain models.
- **06-Jan-2026 (Tuesday):** Worked on scenario-based applications using strings, collections, and custom exceptions including an Invoice Generator for freelancers, Phone Contact Organizer, Online Food Delivery System, Hospital Patient Management, and Ride-Hailing Application. Designed additional simple systems for quizzes, student reports, and library book checkout using lists, arrays, and custom validation logic.
